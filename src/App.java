/** 
 *  Write code to:
 *  1. Create a circle with a radius of 100. The circle can be 
 *  located anywhere on the screen to start. 
 *  
 *  When the mouse is clicked: 
 *  1. The color of the circle should change randomly.
 *  2. The center of the circle should move to a location that 
 *     is 1/2 of the x and y coordinates of the mouse's current location
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * If the mouse is clicked at (500, 200), the circle should change 
 * its location so that its center is at (250, 100) because 500/2 = 250 and 
 * 200/2 = 100. It should also change its color to a random color.
 * 
 * If the mouse is clicked at (88, 140) the circle should change its 
 * location so that its center is at (44, 70) because 88/2 = 44 and 
 * 140/2 = 70. Again the color should change randomly.
 * 
 * To earn an A+:
 * 
 * Complete all the above requirements and surprise me! Be creative in 
 * showing me that you have a mastery of the JavaDraw concepts. This can 
 * be anything that you'd like that you think is impressive!
